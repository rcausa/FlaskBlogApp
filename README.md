# Flask blog API

An API created in order to practice creating and using hash tables, linked lists, binary search trees, stacks and queues.

Routes:
- Create user: '/user'
- Delete user: '/user/<user_id>
- Get all users by ascending id: 'user/<ascending_id>'
- Get all users by descending id: 'user/<descending_id>'
- Get one user by id: 'user/<user_id>'

- Create blog post: '/blog_post/<user_id>'
- Get one blog post by blog_post id: '/blog_post/<blog_post_id>'
- Delete the last 10 blog post entries: '/blog_post/delete_last_10'



Created following along with the freeCodeCamp [tutorial] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-data-structures-flask-api-python/).
